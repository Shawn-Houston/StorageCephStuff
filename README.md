# Install IBM Storage Ceph
This repository includes serveral ways to install IBM Storage Ceph including connected and disconnected options. This is not a comprehensive archive for every possible installation option, it is intended only as a short list of common install options that can be adapated to many IBM Storage Ceph installations.

First let's cover the difference between a connected and a disconnected install. A connected install means you have direct internet access to the IBM Storage Ceph RPMs and containers. A disconnected install means that the installation must use mirrored repositories for both RPMs and containers (registry).

## Connected Install

### Simple (All OSDs are identical)

### Complex (OSDs are not identical or are compound)

## Disconnected Install (offline)
You will need to create a DNF/YUM repo to provide IBM Storage Ceph RPMs, and you will need to mirror the IBM Storage Ceph containers to a local registry.
